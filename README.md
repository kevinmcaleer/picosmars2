# FaceBot

This is fun project (read more about it here: <https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/facebot>) that uses an 8x8 LED Matrix to display text and icons. You can even sequence a few icons together into an animation.

To create icons you can use the `icon_maker.py` program - its a TKInter based user interface and you can draw icons on the screen and get the text underneath you can copy into your code.

The `matrix_test.py` program is a demonstration of how the LED matrix works.

Have fun coding!
